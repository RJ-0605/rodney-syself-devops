Database Guide: Choosing MySQL with Helm Charts

- * 1. Introduction
       This guide outlines the rationale for choosing MySQL as the database for my  CRM application, i seek to detail the implementation plan using custom built MYSQL  Helm charts, and explains why i decided to customize our own Helm chart.
- * 2. Why MySQL?
       MySQL is a well-established, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability, scalability, and ease of use. Hereâ€™s why MySQL is an excellent choice for the CRM application:
       a. **Relational Data Structure**: The CRM application requires structured data storage with complex relationships between entities, making a relational database like MySQL ideal.
       b. **ACID Compliance**: MySQL ensures data integrity through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, which is crucial for the transactional nature of CRM systems.
       c. **Scalability**: MySQL offers robust scalability options, enabling the CRM application to handle growth in data volume and user load.
       d. **Active Community and Support**: MySQL's large user base and active development community provide access to a wealth of resources, updates, and security patches.
- 3. Custom SQl HELm CHart
     I must add that i built this custom SQL helm chart from ground up with the tradtional SQL manifests which can be found in the Kubernetes Documentation.
- 4. StatefulSets for MySQL
     We chose to deploy MySQL using StatefulSets for the following reasons:

     a. Stable Network Identities: Each pod in a StatefulSet has a unique, stable network identifier, which is crucial for MySQL replication.
     b. Persistent Storage: StatefulSets work well with persistent volumes, ensuring that data remains intact even when pods are rescheduled.
     c. Ordered Deployment & Scaling: StatefulSets ensure that MySQL pods are deployed and scaled in an orderly manner, maintaining data consistency.
- 5. Implementation Plan
     Summary: Created a custom Helm chart to manage the deployment of MySQL with the following components.
     * StatefulSet: This is used to manage the deployment and scaling of MySQL instances.
     * Services: Includes both a headless service for internal communication between MySQL pods and a client service for external access.
     * ConfigMap & Secrets: Manages configuration settings and sensitive data like passwords.

7. Custom Helm Chart: We opted to create a custom Helm chart instead of relying entirely on existing charts for the following reasons:
   * Customization: We needed specific configurations tailored to our application's needs, such as custom replication settings and security enhancements.
   * Control & Flexibility: Customizing the Helm chart allowed us to maintain full control over the deployment, ensuring it aligns with our production-readiness criteria.
   * Integration: Our custom chart is designed to integrate seamlessly with other components of our application, which are managed in a unified Helm chart.
8. Deployment Steps:
   * Configure your Kubernetes cluster and ensure persistent storage is available.
   * Deploy the MySQL StatefulSet using the custom Helm chart.
   * Monitor the deployment using Kubernetes tools and ensure the database is functioning correctly.
